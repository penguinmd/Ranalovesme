## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js + Express
- SQLite database
- JWT authentication
- Multer for file uploads
- Joi for validation

### Frontend
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Axios for API calls
- React Leaflet for maps
- date-fns for date formatting

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- **Auth**: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`
- **Days**: `/api/days` (CRUD operations)
- **Places**: `/api/places` (CRUD operations)
- **Photos**: `/api/photos` (upload, view, delete)
- **Music**: `/api/music` (CRUD operations)
- **Activities**: `/api/activities` (CRUD operations)

## Development Tips

### Backend Development
- Backend uses nodemon for auto-restart on file changes
- Database is SQLite stored in `backend/database.sqlite`
- Uploaded photos stored in `backend/uploads/`

### Frontend Development
- Frontend uses Vite for fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- API calls are proxied through Vite dev server
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling

## Building for Production

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start  # Uses Node.js directly in production
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build      # Creates production build in dist/
npm run preview    # Preview production build locally
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check if port 3001 is already in use
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check for error messages in the console

### Frontend won't start
- Check if port 3000 is already in use
- Ensure backend is running first
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Can't login/register
- Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:3001
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify API endpoint in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`

### Photos won't upload
- Ensure `backend/uploads` directory exists
- Check file size (default limit is 10MB)
- Check file type (images only)

## Features Highlights

1. **Secure Authentication** - JWT-based auth with protected routes
2. **Rich Content** - Track days with moods, ratings, and descriptions
3. **Interactive Maps** - Visualize places you've visited
